	<h1>"Git Basic Commands in Bash"</h1>

	<h3>"git" is keeping track of the changes in our project it's a version control system used on your local computer.</h3>
	<br />
	<h3> Frequently used Bash Commands </h3>
	<br />
	<div id="accordion">

	 <h3>Where am I ?</h3>
		<div>
		<p> pwd: To figure out where you are</p>
		</div>

	<h3>Change Directory </h3>
		<div>
		<h4>cd destination: to change your directory</h4>
		<p>
		EX: <br />
			cd ~  :to direct you to your Home Directory/Folder
			<br />
			cd E: :to direct you to E partition (Just change the partition name to direct you to any partition)
			<br />
			cd .. :to go back one directory
		</p>
		</div>


	<h3>List files/folders </h3>
	<div>
	<p> ls :to list all the folders inside </p>
	</div>

	<h3>Start a new Repository </h3>
	<div>
	<p>git init :to initialize a git Repository/Project inside  your current folder </p>
	</div>

	<h3>list all folders including the hidden ones </h3>
	<div>
	<p> ls -la :to list all folders including the hidden ones</p>
	</div>

	<h3>Clear the screen</h3>
	<div>
	<p> clear : to clear everything on the screen</p>
	</div>


	<h3>Adding changes to the Repo.</h3>
	<div>
	<p>git add <span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:20px;">.</span> : to add the changes to our repository/Project
	<br/>Ex :<br/> git add filename.extension : to add a specific file
	<p>The period refers to the current directory and can be used as a shortcut to refer to all files and directories 
	(including all nested files and directories!).</p>
	<br />
	You may encounter a warning "warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in 3d.html." You can ignore it or you can use 
		git config core.autocrlf true to eliminate it.
	Adding a file to a repository on a git server goes into 3 stages : 
	<ol>
	<li>Working copy (in your local computer) </li>
	<li> Staging area ( when you use git add , you actually assign the files to be commited to the server) </li>
	<li>repository ( when you use git commit , you send the files that in staging area to the repository).</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
	</div>


	<h3>Commiting Changes</h3>
	<div>
		<p><span style="font-weight:bold;"> NOTE </span> Berfore commiting your first commit you have to configure Git with an Email and User name <p>
		<p> git config --global user.email "amr.abdeen@iedu-eg.com"</p>
		<p> git config --global user.name "AmrAbdeen"</p>
	<p>git commit -m "Write a indication message of changes":
	to commit our changes so we can keep tracking of it .commiting changes means we keep the first modified version of the project so ever after furthr changes we can get back to it again and modify whatever you want.</p>

		<br>
		<p> 
		 a commit shouldn't include unrelated changes - changes to the sidebar and rewording content in the footer.
		These two aren't related to each other and shouldn't be included in the same commit.
		Work on one change first, commit that, and then change the second one. 
		That way, if it turns out that one change had a bug and you have to undo it, you don't have to undo the other change too.

	 <h3>Pushing to Github server</h3>
	<div>
		<p> You can find the repo URL in Quick setup page </p>
		<p>To change the URL to a name to make it easy to use : git remote add RepoName URL </p>
		<p> git push RepoName </p>
		</div>

	<h3>Viewing the Repo. log</h3>
	<div>
		<p>git log : to view the commit history</p>
		<h3> Navigating The Log </h3>
			<p>If you're not used to a pager on the command line, navigating in Less can be a bit odd. Here are some helpful keys:</p>
			<p>
				to scroll down, press
				j or ↓ to move down one line at a time
				d to move by half the page screen
				f to move by a whole page screen
				to scroll up, press
				k or ↑ to move up one line at a time
				u to move by half the page screen
				b to move by a whole page screen
				press q to quit out of the log (returns to the regular command prompt)
		</p>
		<h3>The git log command has a flag that can be used to alter how it displays the repository's information.</h3>
		<p>That flag is --onelineThe git log command has a flag that can be used to alter how it displays the repository's information.
			That flag is --oneline
			<span style="font-weight:bold">git log --oneline</span></p> 
		<br>
		<h3>git log --stat</h3>
			<p>The git log command has a flag that can be used to display the files that have been changed in the commit, 
				as well as the number of lines that have been added or deleted. The flag is <span style="font-weight:bold">--stat<span> 
				("stat" is short for "statistics")</p>
		<br>
		<h3> git log -p </h3>
				<p>
				The git log command has a flag that can be used to display the actual changes made to a file. 
				The flag is --patch which can be shortened to just -p	
				</p>	


				<h3> New Command: git show </h3>

				<p>The other command that shows a specific commit is git show </p>
					<p> git show fdf5493 <p>
				#<span style="font-weight:bold">fdf5493 </span> is the SHA number
	</div>

	 <h3>Viewing Users Updates/Changes</h3>
	<div>
	<p>git log --author="Name" : to view changes by a specifi user in the project team</p>
	</div>


	 <h3>Viewing files Status</h3>
	<div>
	<p>git status : to view the status of the tracked files ( modified / deleted / new files add / ..etc.)</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight:bold">You should have it as your goal to run the git status command both before and after any other Git command.
			The git status output will give you advice or hints as to what you should do next.
			<span></p>
	</div>


	 <h3>Exit any Text in the terminal</h3>
	<div>
	<p>shift+Q : to exit from any text page</p>
	</div>

	 <h3>View the difference between file versions</h3>
	<div>
	<p>git diff : to show the difference between the original one in the main repository and the modified one on your local computer (which is not commited or added yet ).</p>
	</div>


	<h3>stagged files and the original</h3>
	<div>
	<p> git diff --staged : to show the difference between the stagged files and the original files in the repository.
	</p>
	</div>


	 <h3>File Removal</h3>
	<div>
	<p> git rm filename : to remove the file from the repository and the computer itself and you need to commit the removel ;so that command is followed by : git commit -m "removal message"
	</p>
	</div>


	 <h3>Rename a file</h3>
	<div>
	<p> git mv Oldfilename.extension NewfileName.extension : to rename a file within repository (mv stands for move , think of it as move the name of the old file to the new one "as a metafor to easily remind it").</p>
	</div>

	<h3>Moving a file</h3>
	<div>
	<p>git mv file.extension folder/ : to move a file into a folder . If you want to move and rename use : git mv Filename.extension folder/newName.extension</p>
	</div>

	<h3>Adding (all) modified files to Repo.</h3>
	<div>
	<p>git commit -am "message" : to add (all) modified files into the repository directly with no need to put them in the staging area first but if you want to add a specific file to the repository use the regular instruction ( add then commiy)</p>
	</div>


	 <h3>Restoring a file from the Repo.</h3>
	<div>
	<p>git checkout -- file.extension : to replace the file in your local PC with the one in repository ( think of it as restoring the file to its original state)</p>
	</div>


	  <h3>Unstage</h3>
	<div>
	<p>git reset HEAD fileName.extension: to unstage any file in the stagging area</p>
	</div>


	  <h3>Back to a specific commit</h3>
	<div>
	<p>git checkout commitNumber -- file.extension : to get back to a specific commit but firstly, you have to check the git log to know the commitNumber (mostly like a hash number.) and then you have to commit these changes.</p>
	</div>

	<h3 style="font-color:red">Git Ignore</h3>
	<div>
		<p>	
		If you want to keep a file in your project's directory structure but make sure it isn't accidentally committed to the project,
		you can use the specially named file, .gitignore (note the dot at the front, it's important!). 
		Add this file to your project in the same directory that the hidden .git directory is located. 
		All you have to do is list the names of files that you want Git to ignore (not track) and it will ignore them.
		</p>
		</div>

	<h3>Globbing Crash Course</h3>
	<div>
			Let's say that you add 50 images to your project, but want Git to ignore all of them. 
			Does this mean you have to list each and every filename in the .gitignore file? Oh gosh no, that would be crazy! 
			Instead, you can use a concept called globbing.

		Globbing lets you use special characters to match patterns/characters. In the .gitignore file, you can use the following:

		blank lines can be used for spacing
		# - marks line as a comment
		* - matches 0 or more characters
		? - matches 1 character
		[abc] - matches a, b, or c
		** - matches nested directories - a/**/z matches
		a/z
		a/b/z
		a/b/c/z
		So if all of the 50 images are JPEG images in the "samples" folder, we could add the following line to .gitignore to have Git ignore all 50 images.

		samples/*.jpg

	</div>	

		<h3>Tagging</h3>

		<div>
			<p> Tagging: is giving a specific commit a specific name like: V1.0 </p>
			The command we'll be using to interact with the repository's tags is the git tag command:

			<code>$ git tag -a v1.0</code>

			<h4>Verify Tag </h4>
			<p>
				After saving and quitting the editor, nothing is displayed on the command line. 
				So how do we know that a tag was actually added to the project? If you type out just 
				<span style="font-weight:bold">git tag</span>, 
				it will display all tags that are in the repository.
			</p>
			<p> <span style="color:red">Delete a tag</span></p>
			<code> git tag -d <tag-name> </code>
			<code> git tag -delete <tag-name> </code>	

			<p>
				<span style="font-weight:bold">CAREFUL:</span> In the command above <span style="red">(git tag -a v1.0)</span> the -a flag is used.
				This flag tells Git to create an annotated flag. If you don't provide the flag (i.e. git tag v1.0)
				then it'll create what's called a lightweight tag.

				Annotated tags are recommended because they include a lot of extra information such as:

				the person who made the tag
				the date the tag was made
				a message for the tag
				Because of this, you should always use annotated tags.
			</p>
			<h4>Deleting A Tag </h4>
				<code>git tag -d v1.0</code>
			<h4> Adding A Tag To A Past Commit </h4>
				<p> All you have to do is provide the SHA of the commit you want to tag!</p>
					<code> git tag -a v1.0 a87984 </code>

		</div>	

	<!--*************Branching*************-->	
	<h3> Branching </h3>	
		<p> Branches are bowerful as they give us the ability to work in the same project in different environment 
				<br> <br>
				the default branch is the <span style="font-weight"> Master </span> branch
				There's a <span style="font-weight">Head pointer </span> that points to the Master branch so if we want to move to another branch we can change
					where the Head pointer is pointing to	
					<br> <br>
				<img src="http://i64.tinypic.com/25q8al1.png" border="0" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic">
				<br>
				<br>
				<code> git branch </code>
					<br><br>
					* list all branch names in the repository <br>
					<br>
					* create new branches <br>
					<br>	
					* delete branches <br>
				
				<br>
				<br>
				<span style="font-weight:bold">Create a branch </span> <br> <br>
				<code> git branch branch-name </code> <br><br>
					<span style="font-weight:bold">The git checkout Command </span> <br> <br>
					to switch between branches, we need to use Git's checkout command.<br><br>
					<code>git checkout branch-name </code><br><br>
					<span style="font-weight:bold"> Delete A Branch </span> <br><br>
					<code> git branch -d branch-name </code> <br> <br>
					<code> git branch -delete branch-name </code>
					<br> <br>
					 To force deletion, you need to use a capital D flag -
					<br> <br>		
					<code> git branch -D branch-name </code>
					</p>
